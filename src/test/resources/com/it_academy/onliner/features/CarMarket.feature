Feature: As a logged in/not logged in user
  I want to see a sub menu
  On hovering the CarMarket menu section
  So I can navigate through the available categories

  Scenario: CarMarket sub menu should contain appropriate categories
    Given the user opens Onliner website
    Then main navigation menu is displayed
    When the user hover over the "Автобарахолка" menu section
    Then a sub menu appears
    Then user verifies CarMarket cities links are displayed
      |Минск|
      |Гомель|
      |Могилев|
      |Витебск|
      |Гродно|
      |Брест|
    And user verifies car models are displayed
      |Audi|
      |BMW |
      |Citroen|
      |Ford   |
      |Mazda|
      |Mercedes-Benz|
      |Nissan|
      |Opel  |
      |Peugeot|
